          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            In the early days of 1995, our founders, Rowan Swift and Kayleigh
            Current, found themselves caught in the eddy of their passion for
            whitewater rafting. With a shared dream to create a family-focused
            rafting experience, they set out to build a company that would make
            a splash in the world of adventure sports.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pooling their resources, Rowan and Kayleigh launched "Rapid Bonds
            Whitewater Rafting," making waves in the industry with their unique
            blend of family-friendly fun and adrenaline-pumping thrills. They
            built their team with a crew of buoyant, seasoned rafting guides who
            were all oar-struck by their love for the river and the excitement
            of navigating its rapids.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, the company has continued to flourish, providing
            unforgettable river escapades for thousands of families. By
            remaining anchored in their values of safety, camaraderie, and
            unbridled adventure, Rapid Bonds has become a trusted name in
            whitewater rafting.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a current of success behind them, Rapid Bonds Whitewater
            Rafting is proud to continue crafting unparalleled experiences for
            families and adventurers, helping them paddle their way to memories
            that will last a lifetime.
